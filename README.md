# GRAPHER

Welcome to GRAPHER, the graph drawing Android app!

# Origin
The Android app for graph drawing and editing known as Grapher was designed and developed by
Algoritmegruppen at UiB in the period of 2012-2015. After some time without maintenance the app
became outdated and lost functionality due to changes in the ever evolving world of Android.

That's why the app was picked up again as a INF219 project to restore the lost
functionality and make it compatible with new, modern Android devices. This is the home to the
new and improved version, made clear from the now capitalized name.

# Changes from the original app

* The app has been rewritten from Java into Kotlin
* Implementation of the external graph library JgraphT was changed to work with the newer version
* GitHub Actions are used for automatic building and deployment to Google Play using workflows

# Current features

The graph manipulation is done using two modes: Node and Edge

* Node Mode
Used to place and move nodes around the workspace. Marking nodes in this mode by clicking
on them signals which nodes to perform specific algorithms on in the graph (ex. Max Flow).

* Edge Mode
Used to place edges between nodes.
