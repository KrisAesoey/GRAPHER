# GRAPHER

Welcome to GRAPHER, the graph drawing Android app!

# Origin
The Android app for graph drawing and editing known as GRAPHER was designed and developed by
Algoritmegruppen at UiB in the period of 2012-2015. After some time without maintenance the app
became outdated and lost functionality due to changes in the ever evolving world of Android.

That's why the app was picked up again as a INF219 project to restore the lost
functionality and make it compatible with new, modern Android devices.

# Changes from the original app

* The app has been rewritten from Java into Kotlin
* Implementation of the external graph library JgraphT was changed to work with the newer version
* GitHub Actions are used for automatic building and deployment to Google Play using workflows
